#spark learn backend

COMPLETE: Api for spark learn, only handles authentication with jwt auth token both with login and signup

WORK IN PROGRESS: Next step would be to register the platforms  on  our system along with their oauth credentials, still work in progress

YET: Test out the application with one of the many apis for learning sites
